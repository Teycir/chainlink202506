# High Issues

## H-1: Unsafe Casting of integers

Downcasting int/uints in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior.When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (e.g., uint256 to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type,leading to truncation and loss of significant digits. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeCast library to safely downcast integers.

	```solidity
	    userState.claimed += uint248(toBeClaimed);
	```

</details>



## H-2: Storage Array Edited with Memory

Storage reference is passed to a function with a memory parameter. This will not update the storage variable as expected. Consider using storage parameters instead.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Large Numeric Literal

Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation.Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

	```solidity
	  uint256 private constant PERCENTAGE_BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR = 10_000;
	```

</details>



## L-2: Loop Contains `require`/`revert`

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop

	```solidity
	    for (uint256 i = 0; i < paramsLength; ++i) {
	```

</details>



## L-3: Costly operations inside loop

Invoking `SSTORE` operations in loops may waste gas. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.
