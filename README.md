# Chainlink BUILD Rewards Contracts Security Audit

This repository showcases my independent security research on Chainlink's BUILD rewards smart contract ecosystem. Through comprehensive manual analysis, static scanning, and custom proof-of-concept (PoC) development, I identified and documented **8 critical and high-impact vulnerabilities**. These findings demonstrate significant security flaws that could lead to permanent fund loss and system compromise.

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count | Impact | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Critical** | 3 | Permanent fund loss | ✅ Documented |
| **High** | 5 | DoS, fund lock, bypass | ✅ Documented |
| **Total** | **8** | **System-wide risks** | **Comprehensive** |

## Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 1. Unsafe Type Cast Leading to Fund Theft
**Contract**: `BUILDClaim.sol` | **Impact**: Complete token drain via overflow

- **Root Cause**: Unsafe cast from `uint256` to `uint248` in `_updateClaimedAmounts()`
- **Attack Vector**: Attacker triggers overflow to reset claimed amount, enabling multiple claims
- **Funds at Risk**: Entire season allocation can be drained by single user
- **PoC**: Demonstrates complete fund theft via arithmetic overflow exploitation

### 2. Incomplete State Cleanup on Project Removal
**Contract**: `BUILDFactory.sol` | **Impact**: Permanent fund lock

- **Root Cause**: `removeProjects()` only deletes project config, leaves financial state intact
- **Attack Vector**: Removed project's funds become permanently inaccessible
- **Funds at Risk**: All deposited tokens for removed projects
- **PoC**: Shows definitive permanent fund lock scenario

### 3. Arithmetic Overflow in Claim Calculation
**Contract**: `BUILDClaim.sol` | **Impact**: Permanent DoS for large allocations

- **Root Cause**: Multiplication overflow in vesting calculation for large token amounts
- **Attack Vector**: Users with large allocations cannot claim, funds permanently locked
- **Funds at Risk**: All tokens allocated to users with large amounts
- **PoC**: Demonstrates permanent claim failure with panic revert

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. Division by Zero DoS Attack
**Contract**: `BUILDClaim.sol` | **Impact**: Season-wide claim failure

- **Root Cause**: Unprotected division in loyalty bonus calculation
- **Attack Vector**: Early claim of full season amount causes division by zero for all other users
- **Risk**: Complete DoS for entire season after single user action
- **PoC**: Shows how one user can lock all other participants

### 5. Incorrect Fund Availability Calculation
**Contract**: `BUILDFactory.sol` | **Impact**: Permanent fund lock

- **Root Cause**: `_calcMaxAvailableForWithdrawalOrNewSeason()` doesn't account for claimed tokens
- **Attack Vector**: Claimed tokens become permanently unwithdrawable
- **Risk**: Gradual accumulation of locked funds as users claim
- **PoC**: Demonstrates funds becoming permanently inaccessible

### 6. Pause Mechanism Bypass
**Contract**: `BUILDClaim.sol` | **Impact**: Emergency controls failure

- **Root Cause**: `withdraw()` function missing `whenClaimNotPaused` modifier
- **Attack Vector**: Project admin can withdraw funds even when contract is paused
- **Risk**: Bypass of critical safety mechanism during emergencies
- **PoC**: Shows successful withdrawal during paused state

## Technical Methodology

### Analysis Approach
- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive contract review using Slither, Aderyn, and manual code analysis
- **Dynamic Testing**: Foundry-based PoC development with realistic attack scenarios
- **Invariant Testing**: Echidna fuzzing for property-based testing
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-contract interaction vulnerability assessment
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Overflow/underflow detection and arithmetic validation

### Tools & Frameworks Used
- **Foundry**: Advanced testing framework for PoC development and gas analysis
- **Slither**: Static analysis for vulnerability detection and code quality
- **Aderyn**: Rust-based security scanner for comprehensive analysis
- **Echidna**: Property-based fuzzing for invariant testing
- **Solidity Metrics**: Code complexity and quality analysis

### Proof of Concept Quality
- ✅ **Executable**: All PoCs run with `forge test` commands
- ✅ **Realistic**: Proper contract setup and interaction patterns
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Multiple attack vectors and edge cases covered
- ✅ **Measurable**: Gas costs, fund impact, and exploit quantification
