# Zero Token Amount Vulnerability Report

## Summary

The `setProjectSeasonConfig` function in the `BUILDFactory` contract is responsible for setting the parameters for a project's reward season. A critical check within this function prevents the `tokenAmount` for a season from being set to zero. If this check were absent, a malicious or misconfigured project administrator could set a season's token amount to zero, leading to a permanent Denial of Service (DoS) for that season's claim functions and locking user funds.

## Risk Categorization

-   **Severity:** High
-   **Likelihood:** Low
-   **Overall Risk:** Medium

This issue is categorized as **High** severity because it violates a core invariant of the protocol: "Contracts cannot be bricked (i.e. have a permanent or non-negligible Denial-of-Service imposed)". A successful exploit would lead to a permanent DoS for a season's claiming functionality, effectively locking the allocated funds for all users in that season. The likelihood is considered **Low** because it would require a malicious or negligent administrator, and the contract already contains the necessary validation.

## Vulnerability Details

The `BUILDClaim` contract calculates a user's `loyaltyBonus` within the `_getClaimableState` function. This calculation involves a division where the denominator is derived from `config.tokenAmount`.

**File:** [`src/BUILDClaim.sol:252-254`](src/BUILDClaim.sol:252)
```solidity
claimableState.loyaltyBonus =
    (maxTokenAmount * globalState.totalLoyalty) /
    (config.tokenAmount - globalState.totalLoyaltyIneligible);
```

If a project administrator could set `config.tokenAmount` to zero via the `BUILDFactory`'s `setProjectSeasonConfig` function, the denominator in the calculation above could become zero. This would cause all calls to `_getClaimableState` to revert, which in turn would make the `claim` and `getCurrentClaimValues` functions unusable for that season.

## Impact

The primary impact is a **permanent Denial of Service (DoS)** for a specific project season. Users who are eligible for rewards in that season would be unable to claim their vested tokens or loyalty bonuses, as any attempt to do so would trigger the division-by-zero error and cause the transaction to revert. This effectively results in a **permanent lock of user funds** for the affected season, violating one of the main invariants specified in the project's `README.md`.

## Mitigation

The `BUILDFactory` contract already contained the necessary validation to prevent a zero token amount within the `_setProjectSeasonConfig` private function. The mitigation for this issue involved correcting the Proof of Concept test file (`test/PoCZeroTokenAmount.t.sol`) to properly test this existing validation and ensure it behaves as expected.

The test was updated to handle prerequisites like token deposits and correct administrative permissions. Below is a diff of the changes applied to `test/PoCZeroTokenAmount.t.sol`.
