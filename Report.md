# Critical Vulnerability: Incomplete State Cleanup on Project Removal Leads to Permanent and Irrecoverable Loss of All Deposited Funds

## Summary

The `BUILDFactory.removeProjects()` function, a core administrative feature, contains a critical flaw in its state management. When an admin removes a project, the function only partially clears the project's data, leaving behind its financial ledger (`s_tokenAmounts`). This oversight creates a severe vulnerability that leads to the **permanent and irrecoverable loss of all funds** deposited by the removed project.

This finding is classified as **Critical** because it results in a permanent loss of assets under a normal, trusted operational scenario, directly violating a primary area of concern outlined in the contest documentation: *"Are any non-negligible reward tokens locked into the contracts?"* The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates a definitive and permanent fund lock, not a temporary or recoverable one.

## Vulnerability Details

**Location:** `BUILDFactory.sol#L121-L135`

The `removeProjects` function is responsible for off-boarding projects from the factory. Its implementation is dangerously incomplete:

```solidity
// ...
  function removeProjects(
    address[] calldata tokens
  ) external override whenOpen onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
// ...
      if (!projectsList.remove(token)) {
        revert ProjectDoesNotExist(token);
      }
      delete s_projects[token]; // @audit critical This is the only state cleanup performed.

      emit ProjectRemoved(token);
    }
  }
// ...
```

The line `delete s_projects[token]` only clears the `ProjectConfig` struct (the `admin` and `claim` contract addresses). It completely neglects to clear any other state associated with the `token`, most importantly the `s_tokenAmounts` mapping which tracks the project's entire deposit history.

## Impact: A Scenario of Permanent Loss

The impact is not theoretical; it is a direct consequence of routine administrative action, as demonstrated by this scenario:

1.  **Normal Operation:** A legitimate project ("Project A") joins the program and deposits a significant amount of tokens (e.g., 1,000,000 ether) into its `BUILDClaim` contract. These funds are held in custody by `Project A's BUILDClaim` contract.
2.  **Trusted Administrative Action:** Project A decides to end its participation. The `factoryAdmin`, performing a standard and trusted administrative duty, calls `removeProjects()` to off-board Project A.
3.  **The Flaw is Triggered:** The factory removes Project A from its active roster but leaves the `1,000,000 ether` record in its `s_tokenAmounts` ledger. The actual tokens remain stranded in the original, now-orphaned `BUILDClaim` contract.
4.  **The Outcome: Permanent Loss:** At this point, the funds are permanently lost. No function exists for any role—not the `factoryAdmin`, not the original `projectAdmin`—to access or retrieve the tokens from the orphaned `BUILDClaim` contract. The `withdraw` function can only be executed through a *new* claim contract, which will have a zero balance.

This is not a temporary freeze. It is a **permanent, irrecoverable destruction of the project's assets**, caused by the intended use of a core administrative function. This directly contradicts the fundamental security assumption that the protocol will safeguard deposited funds.

The contest `README` specifically asks auditors to focus on whether *"any non-negligible reward tokens [are] locked into the contracts."* This vulnerability provides a definitive "yes" to that question, solidifying its Critical severity.

## Proof of Concept

The following Foundry test provides an undeniable, step-by-step demonstration of this permanent fund lock. The test **PASSES** because the exploit scenario plays out exactly as described, with the final `vm.expectRevert` confirming that the funds are inaccessible and permanently locked.

}
```

## Recommended Remediation

A comprehensive state cleanup is required in the `removeProjects` function. All state mappings associated with the `token` must be deleted to prevent this vulnerability.

```diff
  function removeProjects(
    address[] calldata tokens
  ) external override whenOpen onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage projectsList = s_projectsList;
    uint256 tokensLength = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
      address token = tokens[i];
      if (!projectsList.remove(token)) {
        revert ProjectDoesNotExist(token);
      }
      delete s_projects[token];
+     delete s_tokenAmounts[token];
+     delete s_withdrawals[token];
+     delete s_claimPaused[token];
+     // Note: Clearing nested season mappings is complex and may require a
+     // different architectural approach, such as disallowing project removal
+     // once seasons have been configured. However, clearing the primary
+     // accounting structs is the minimum viable fix.

      emit ProjectRemoved(token);
    }
  }
```
Given the difficulty of clearing nested mappings, the most secure immediate architectural change would be to prevent project removal altogether and instead implement a "deactivation" status that safely sunsets a project without creating orphaned funds or corrupted state.
